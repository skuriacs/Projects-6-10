# Project 6

This project will work with cleaning two data sets ( exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia) and focus on cleaning and then analyzing data from them. Main two questions we'll be answering in this project:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
