# Project 6

This project will work with cleaning two data sets ( exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia) and focus on cleaning and then analyzing data from them. Main two questions we'll be answering in this project:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

# Project 8 
Project 8 deals with a fun little survey that interviewed a random sample of people and whether or not they've viewed star wars or not. The Project mainly dealt with some data cleaning, replacing vague values with True / False, and then plotting the ranking of movies between star-trek fans and non star-trek fans (came out very similarly).

# Project 9 
A basic little SQL project (Using SQLite and jupyter) where it took a dataset of countries and then found countries that had bigger than average populations but lower than average land areas.
